# functional programming

This repository is ment to track my progress for the next two or six weeks. In the first week I'm trying to learn how to clean up datasets. For practice I'm using a dummy dataset which was a survey with all kinds of random questions that 92 students answered. Using `.map()` and `.filter()` I'm cleaning up the data and making one column have one format only. Currently I'm trying to clean op the colomn with eye colors (hex values). After this practice I will use parking data from the RDW insitute to make a data visualisation using the D3 library.
